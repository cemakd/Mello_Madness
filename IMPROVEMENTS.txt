We've done several things to improve the game for the beta:
    - We've revamped most of our levels and added a few more, focusing on introducing all of our mechanics early and then making players think on later levels with more complex and demanding puzzles
    - Added a "hub world" level select option, rather than having a static level select screen
    - Tons of aesthethic changes, cute s'more animation on level finish, multiple parallax backgrounds, multiple tile colors, scene transition (candy wave!)
    - Bugfixes, fixed background tearing, level softlocks, death bugs, animation bugs, etc
    - Getting stuck in chocolate kills you now
    - Made helper sprites xbox only
    - Made moving platforms more robust
    - Added a second jump sound to make the characters have different voices
    - Minor changes to BGM
