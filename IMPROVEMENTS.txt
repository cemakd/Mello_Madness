We've done several things to improve the game for the alpha:
    - We've added two substantial new mechanics (moving platforms, and sliding while transformed) to add more interesting behavior to build levels on
    - We've introduced a player guidance system that can draw lines and form shapes in an attractive way, although we haven't integrated it everywhere yet
    - We've reworked several bugs and non-intuitive moments that we discovered while having other players play through our levels.
    - We have a large, cool, rework for the level select screen in progress, but it is not alpha-ready.
    - We've added a parallax background to make the levels feel more alive.
    - We've moved debug controls from the controller to the keyboard so players don't accidentally hit them
    - We've removed our shifting mechanic from the first level, as players don't need it and haven't been introduced to it and so might be confused by it
    - We've modified our button prompts to be gamepad-agnostic (both Playstation and Xbox)
    - We've added original music and sound effects to the game! No samples used!
