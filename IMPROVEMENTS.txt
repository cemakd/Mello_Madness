We have addressed feedback in the following areas:

Aesthetic: We got feedback about the aesthetic of the main characters, and that they needed more personality. To this end, we have given them animated faces that face the direction they move, and look at each other when they are transformed. This also helped move the aesthetic away from Avalanche. We also added a significant update to the level aesthetics themselves, giving them a more finished feel the background and new grid blocks. Finally, we added steps towards theming with graham cracker and chocolate block doors. 

Button/Switches: There was some ambiguity in our previous edition between buttons/latches and which blocks they controlled. We made steps to fix this by removing latches (which are permanent) after they are activated, and having a visual distinction (chocolate vs. graham cracker) between latches and buttons.

Audio: We added ambient background music! Sound effects and more music will come in the next iterations!

J-Frames: The game features a small amount of frames after running of a platform where they can still jump.

Variable Jump Input: The game features variable jump and wall jump heights depending on how quickly the jump button is tapped.

Collaboration: Previous versions of our game have only featured small amounts of teamwork. Our newly added levels address this by adding more in-depth team-play and more challenging puzzles.

Camera: We had some struggles with how to adjust the camera based on both players, and whether or not the camera should force the players to stay in the viewport. Instead of bounding players, we now have offscreen indicators that allow the player to know where they are when off the camera without being obtrusive or limiting player movement to the viewport.

Level Creation: We spent a significant amount of time working on level creation mechanisms, so we can quickly churn out future levels!
